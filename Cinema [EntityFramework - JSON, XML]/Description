This project is based on an Exam from Soft Uni.
The learning module is "Entity framework - Databases with C#"
It shows that I have been practicing and I am familiar with the following .NET libraries:
  - Newtonsoft.Json;
  - Xml.Serialization;
  - Automapper;
  - ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
  
The application creates a database using the Entity Framework "Code First" technique.
There is a capture of the database diagriam, just to make it easier to understand.
